It just toggles between 'range' mode and 'single' mode but feel free to take the code and enhance it however you want.

And please don't submit any Issues. I'm sure it has issues. This was just a fun POC for my own learning and amusement that I thought I'd share, and put somewhere where I can get to it later if I ever need it.
