# primeng-calendar-mode-toggle-directive
Angular 11 Directive that adds Selection Mode toggle to PrimeNG Calendar component

Working StackBlitz:

https://stackblitz.com/edit/primeng-calendar-demo-with-selectionmode-toggle-directive?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcalendar-mode-toggle.directive.ts

I put the toggle button in the button bar below the calendar because it seemed like a convenient place for it.

It just toggles between 'range' mode and 'single' mode but feel free to take the code and enhance it however you want.
