# primeng-calendar-mode-toggle-directive
Angular 11 Directive that adds Selection Mode toggle to PrimeNG Calendar component

Working StackBlitz:

https://stackblitz.com/edit/primeng-calendar-demo-with-selectionmode-toggle-directive?file=src%2Fapp%2Fcalendar-mode-toggle.directive.ts

I put the toggle button in the button bar below the calendar because it seemed like a convenient place for it.

It just toggles between 'range' mode and 'single' mode but feel free to take the code and enhance it however you want.

And please don't submit any Issues. I'm sure it has issues. This was just a fun POC for my own learning and amusement that I thought I'd share, and put somewhere where I can get to it later if I ever need it.
